# auto-factin

This repository contains data and MATLAB scripts to classify dendritic spines and automatically calculate the cumulative F-actin lengths in the putative head and neck regions of mushroom spines.

The repository is split into two folders: mice and rat, each having spine images derived from neuronal cultures and MATLAB scripts to analyze them. Before running any of the scripts, please unrar the spines.rar file in each folder which containes multichannel images of putative dendritic spines.
